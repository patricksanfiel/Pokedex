## Extended Description
A Pokedex application built with React and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can search for Pokemon via list or search. Once a user clicks on a Pokemon, an entry for that Pokemon containing its relevant attributes is displayed. Users can click through a carousel of sprites and pages of moves corresponding to each Pokemon. Check out a live demo [here](https://patricksanfiel.github.io/Pokedex/)
